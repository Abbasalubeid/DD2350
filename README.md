## Course contents

Design principles of algorithms: Decomposition, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, local and exhaustive search. Algorithm analysis. Approximation algorithms and heuristics. Applications with algorithms for problems on sets, graphs, arithmetic and geometry. Implementation of algorithms.

Data structures: Review of hash tables and heaps; balanced trees, Bloom filters, persistent data structures Use and implementation of data structures. Computability and complexity: The concept of reduction, the complexity classes P (polynomial time) and NP (non-deterministic polynomial time). NP-complete problems, undecidable problems. Coping with computationally intractable problems.

- **Probability theory:** 
  - probability, conditional probability, independence
  - one-dimensional random variables
  - briefing about multi-dimensional random variables
  - common distributions
  - measures (location, spreading and dependence)
  - Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem
- **Statistics:** 
  - point estimates, confidence intervals
  - hypothesis test
  - regression analysis, correlation, graphical presentation of data.

## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, the student should be able to

- develop and implement algorithms with data structures and analyse them with respect to correctness and efficiency
- compare alternative algorithms and data structures regarding efficiency and reliability
- define and translate central concepts such as P, NP, NP-completeness and undecidability
- compare problems with respect to complexity by means of reductions
- handle problems with high complexity

in order to

- independently be able to design computer programs that use time and memory efficiently and thereby can contribute to economically and environmentally sustainable development
- in professional life identify and attack problems that are unrealistically resource demanding or not possible to solve on a computer.
